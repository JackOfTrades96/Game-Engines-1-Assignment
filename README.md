# Description Of Project
My Project is based on creating a Voxel based Procedural Generation.

Every Voxel will be generated within  16x256x16 chunks.

I will use both Perlin Noise and Domain Warping to generate a more relasitic world surface.

For the textures I will be using 2d art assets for the voxels textures.

As the voxels are generated there voxel type will determine what textures are rendered on each voxel.

The Player will be able to move around the terrain as well as remove voxels from both the surface of the world and underground.

### Visual Aspects
- Voxel generated Terrain such as Grass fields, Mountians, Valley, Rivers, Lakes etc

- New Voxel terrain being generated as the player moves from its spawn location.

- Uniquqe and sepeerate Biome Types.


### Interactive  Aspects
- Player Movement & Jumping

- Player Camera Controlled by Mouse

- Digging Mechanic
